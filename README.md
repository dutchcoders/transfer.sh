Easy and fast file sharing from the command-line. This code contains the server with everything you need to create your own instance.

Transfer.sh currently supports the s3 (Amazon S3), gdrive (Google Drive) providers, and local file system (local).

## Disclaimer
This project repository has no relation with the service at https://transfer.sh that's managed by https://storj.io.
So far we cannot address any issue related to the service at https://transfer.sh.


## Usage

### Upload:
```bash
$ curl --upload-file ./hello.txt https://transfer.sh/hello.txt
```

### Encrypt & upload:
```bash
$ cat /tmp/hello.txt|gpg -ac -o-|curl -X PUT --upload-file "-" https://transfer.sh/test.txt
````

### Download & decrypt:
```bash
$ curl https://transfer.sh/1lDau/test.txt|gpg -o- > /tmp/hello.txt
```

### Upload to virustotal:
```bash
$ curl -X PUT --upload-file nhgbhhj https://transfer.sh/test.txt/virustotal
```

### Deleting
```bash
$ curl -X DELETE <X-Url-Delete Response Header URL>
```

## Request Headers

### Max-Downloads
```bash
$ curl --upload-file ./hello.txt https://transfer.sh/hello.txt -H "Max-Downloads: 1" # Limit the number of downloads
```

### Max-Days
```bash
$ curl --upload-file ./hello.txt https://transfer.sh/hello.txt -H "Max-Days: 1" # Set the number of days before deletion
```

## Response Headers

### X-Url-Delete

The URL used to request the deletion of a file. Returned as a response header.
```bash
curl -sD - --upload-file ./hello https://transfer.sh/hello.txt | grep 'X-Url-Delete'
X-Url-Delete: https://transfer.sh/hello.txt/BAYh0/hello.txt/PDw0NHPcqU
```

profile-listener | port to use for profiler (:6060)| |
force-https | redirect to https | false |
tls-listener | port to use for https (:443) | |
tls-listener-only | flag to enable tls listener only | |

proxy-path | path prefix when service is run behind a proxy | |
ga-key | google analytics key for the front end | |
uservoice-key | user voice key for the front end  | |
provider | which storage provider to use | (s3, gdrive or local) |
aws-access-key | aws access key | | AWS_ACCESS_KEY
aws-secret-key | aws access key | | AWS_SECRET_KEY
bucket | aws bucket | | BUCKET
s3-endpoint | Custom S3 endpoint. | |
s3-region | region of the s3 bucket | eu-west-1 | S3_REGION
s3-no-multipart | disables s3 multipart upload | false | |
s3-path-style | Forces path style URLs, required for Minio. | false | |
basedir | path storage for local/gdrive provider| |
gdrive-client-json-filepath | path to oauth client json config for gdrive provider| |
gdrive-local-config-path | path to store local transfer.sh config cache for gdrive provider| |
gdrive-chunk-size | chunk size for gdrive upload in megabytes, must be lower than available memory (8 MB) | |
lets-encrypt-hosts | hosts to use for lets encrypt certificates (comma seperated) | |
log | path to log file| |

If you want to use TLS using lets encrypt certificates, set lets-encrypt-hosts to your domain, set tls-listener to :443 and enable force-https.

If you want to use TLS using your own certificates, set tls-listener to :443, force-https, tls-cert=file and tls-private-key.

## Development

Switched to GO111MODULE

```bash
go run main.go --provider=local --listener :8080 --temp-path=/tmp/ --basedir=/tmp/
```

## Build

If on go < 1.11
```bash
go get -u -v ./...
```

```bash
go build -o transfersh main.go
```

## Docker

For easy deployment, we've created a Docker container.

```bash
docker run --publish 8080:8080 dutchcoders/transfer.sh:latest --provider local --basedir /tmp/
```

## S3 Usage

For the usage with a AWS S3 Bucket, you just need to specify the following options:
- provider
- aws-access-key
- aws-secret-key
- bucket
- s3-region

If you specify the s3-region, you don't need to set the endpoint URL since the correct endpoint will used automatically.

### Custom S3 providers

To use a custom non-AWS S3 provider, you need to specify the endpoint as definied from your cloud provider.

## Google Drive Usage

For the usage with Google drive, you need to specify the following options:
- provider
- gdrive-client-json-filepath
- gdrive-local-config-path
- basedir

### Creating Gdrive Client Json

You need to create a Oauth Client id from console.cloud.google.com
download the file and place into a safe directory

### Usage example

```go run main.go --provider gdrive --basedir /tmp/ --gdrive-client-json-filepath /[credential_dir] --gdrive-local-config-path [directory_to_save_config] ```
